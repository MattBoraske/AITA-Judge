TO DO
-----

- script to compare agent results

- add code for dataset collection/creation (helps validate legitimacy of HF dataset)
    - need to do this to get better train/test splits for retrieval
        - right now the test set from the finetuning dataset is too large (too expensive to evaluate)
        - would be nice instead to make the test set 5 or even 2% instead of 10% of total data
        
    - collection = making initial data files using reddit API
    - creation = refinements done to create HF dataset used to train model
    - store initial data file on S3 and include links to download them in the README
        - README in general should explain data collection process
    
- update name for vs creation log w/ timestamp

- fix requirements.txt
    - add specific library versions
    - issue seems to be using the comet model with current installed library versions
        - could also be an issue with running comet on mac... maybe dont use it even

-update readme
