    My brother and his now wife got married three days ago. A very small destination ceremony under 15 people total. My now fiancé and I extended our trip after everyone went home and spent a couple of days exploring the Grand Canyon, a couple hours north of the wedding, where he proposed.

    When I shared the news with my brother and now SIL, he responded with hostility saying that it looked like we were competing.

    I apologized, quickly realizing that he was advocating for my SIL and that she felt hurt (although I’m truly failing to understand why). I also texted her a separate apology and explained that it was not our intent to encroach and just wanted to share the news with family and that it’s my belief that there’s room for happiness for everyone. She did not respond.

    In response to my apology, my brother doubled down and said the timing and location were hurtful and that we shouldn’t planned around the wedding.
