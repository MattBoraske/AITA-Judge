seeing my son during my custody time on a big family holiday and spending the holiday with my ex and his new family (which means not seeing my family on holidays), in which i\u2019m painted as

\u201cstep-mom\u2019s family travelled six hours to see him and it would be rude to leave\u201d. son says \u201ci won\u2019t see dad again till easter and you know he won\u2019t talk to me till then if i leave now, you\u2019re just going to need to stay here\u201d. i told him that it was time to go, that we promised step-dad we\u2019d spend christmas together with *his* parents. son says \u201cthat\u2019s too bad, they\u2019ll have to go without you, i want to see you today but dad says i\u2019m not allowed to go so we\u2019ll have to stay here\u201d.

far). when planning, we decided on a child and pet free(ish) wedding. the first hasn't received any backlash yet (here's hoping), but the second has become an extremely controversial subject in my

attacked by a golden retriever when he was 11. while it wasn't physically severe, it did affect him mentally and he had to go to therapy to be comfortable around dogs. he is now fine around all dogs but golden retrievers. because of this, my sister always visits us without her dog. she's usually fine to go out if she is with our mum and doesn't want to bring the dog, this is what my sister says not me assuming. when my fianc\u00e9 sees a golden retriever in public, he usually tries to stay as far away as possible and avoids them until they pass. this is usually extremely distressing and he can't be in the same area as them. not always resulting in a panic attack, but having him on edge and in flight or fight mode. obviously not ideal for our wedding.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nwhen planning

does when she comes over to visit us. she got extremely upset by this, ranting about how we were discriminating against her and that her service dog was essential for her functioning in life. i brought up how she was her without her service dog 'functioning' fine but she immediately starting crying and having a panic attack. my parents took her side and left quickly with her still crying. my

she was pregnant, no father in sight. my wife flipped on her, full exaggeration and criticism, she thought out kid was throwing her life our of the window because my daughter was eager to keep the baby and my wife wasn't okay with this. she asked me if she could back home for a while, work locally and overall just be around us because she felt scared and lone at her big city and wanted to spend her pregnancy with us, my daughter didn't use much of her college fund (barely 18 to 25%) and had a good amount of savings, she's also the kind of kid who always helped around the house so i said yes.\n\nmy wife didn't had much problem with this, but ever since our daughter came back, she has been passive-aggressive at best. awful comments about how she fucked up her life, how na\u00efve she

wants to get an apartment nearby and maybe raise my grandkid here, my wife just snorted and said that if she already fucked up her life, the least she could do is doing was best for the kid and move somewhere better and maybe do it now. my daughter cried because she was basically getting kicked out and my wife tried to minimize her feelings, so i told her to get out of my house because i was done

cell phone so she could keep in contact with them, etc.). when we moved to our new area, she seemed to fall into a bad crowd. she began drinking, doing drugs and staying out well into the early hours of the morning. the first time she ran away, she was gone for 2 weeks, we had no clue where she was. we got her a therapist and it seemed to work for a while, but then she refused to go and we were

her mental state, on top of her drinking and drug use, we were very worried about how this would go. we tried to persuade her to either abort or give the baby up for adoption, but she insisted on having the baby. she had a very tiny baby girl. we thought maybe this would wake her up. she stayed sober throughout her pregnancy and had started therapy again and we were very supportive. however,

after her 18th birthday, she took off again. my husband and i got full custody of our granddaughter. she came back about 6 months later, sober and promising to be better. we talked it over and had conditions. we told her she had to get a job or enroll in community college, she had to keep attending a.a meetings and parenting classes. we said we didn\u2019t expect her to care for her daughter, but we could work on her being more of a parent and her daughter getting to know her more. she was all for it\u2026for about 6 months. we found out through one of our younger kids that she had dropped out of school and was spending her days with our granddaughter\u2019s father, a bad influence who\u2019s a drug dealer and isn\u2019t going to help her sobriety. a fight broke out and she left. a year

she can turn her life around. we\u2019ve heard this story before. our granddaughter is now 3.5 years old and will remember her mother walking away again. we\u2019re already suspecting this baby will end up in our care too. we have 4 other children (15, 13, 10 and 8) to think of as well. we told her we can\u2019t take her back in this time, though if her baby ends up needing a place to say, we

and other times even throughout the week, it is of course logical she takes showers and such, right?\n\nwell thats where my issue is, she has a similar schedule to me and as a result she occupies the bathroom in the mornings when i need to get to class resulting in me either having to skip my morning shower or wake up way earlier to get to the bathroom first, similar issues occur when i have to go to work, have to use the bathroom etc, add to that the fact that my water bill will probably be astronomical as having her in the apartment for 4 days a week pretty much means she showers as much on a single day as i do in 5 days, as a result i am tired of it.\n\ni tried to compromise by asking her to keep the door unlocked so i can brush my teeth and go to the bathroom, groom my beard, do my hair etc while she is showering(and trust me, i am no fan of going to the toilet in front of anyone) basically to save me time so i can grab a quick shower when she is done, she said she is uncomfortable with leaving the bathroom door unlocked because i have friends over quite a lot, which would be logical if it was not for the fact i dont have friends over at 7 am! \n\nat this point i am just tired of it and have half a mind just to tell her she is not allowed to shower in my apartment in the mornings anymore, so wibta?", "classification": "NTA", "justification": "nta. i would tell her that you

my best friend but she moved out to go live with her bf. living with her was a blast and i never had any problems. once she told her plans to move out, i started looking for a new roomie since i wouldn't be able to afford living on my own (i go to school and work part time). i got two offers and one was from a girl in my friend circles. i wasn't the closest with her but we definitely knew a lot about each other and were pretty good friends. it would have been better to go with girl a since she was a little more stable financially but i decided to go with girl b since i wanted to be a good friend. everything started out well but i quickly noticed something about her that caused a bit of friction. \n\nshe spent a lot of time using (hogging) the bathroom for the most absurd reasons.\n\ni understand wanting to take a long bath here and there or having a condition but that was far from the case. she'd lock herself in the bathroom to do things she could very well do in her room or any other part of the house (ex: to do her makeup, take videos of whatever new product she got, record grwms, etc). she says the bathroom has the best lighting (which i can agree with) but she'd spend so much time in there that i had to start begging her to come out as soon as i got any little urge to go so i would be able to use the bathroom \"on time\". i've brought it up with her so many times now but she'd only change for a few days before hogging up the bathroom once again.\n\nshe's also made a habit of being \"a little late\" with all our payments. if rent is due today, she'd give me 60-80% of it today and then the rest maybe a week or two later. i understand being a little late with rent here and there because of reasons out of your control but it's always happening.

i could see what she was posting, which she agreed to.\n\na couple weeks ago i decided to check her profile, as i hadn't seen one of her posts in a while, despite her being on there all the time. it's public, not private, so she changed her settings, and i'm no longer following her. i'm assuming i was softblocked as i can still see her profile. however, the part that concerned me most was her bio. she has her full date of birth, full name, town name, ethnicity, other info about her, and photos of her and her friends in their school uniforms, with the school crest visible.\n\ni told her why this

didn't invite me and how she never mentioned inviting me. uh... okay, we have both done that before. just because we're close it doesn't mean we include each other in everything. another time he said

having a baby and not waiting for me, like that made any sense at all. my sister was furious with her husband. more so because she drove the point home that he knew i'd had a miscarriage and to then say what he did and smirk about it after. i said only kids get so jealous of their spouse being close to family and that i really wanted to know what his deal was. he acted like he never knew about the miscarriage and then turned it back on me and accused me of shaming him for something he had no idea about. i pointed out i was just calling him on what he had said. he said i should have handled

these contributions were the bare minimum. i excused myself to calm down because at that point i was seeing red. i returned and explained i was happy to give her a gift for the wedding at my own discretion and would pay to be in the wedding if she wanted me to but this list of requirements was unacceptable. the kicker here is she then informed me i was not in the wedding, these were contributions as sister of the groom as her sisters would be bridesmaids. the argument escalated and both of us said some awful things. when i called her a  gold digger she burst into tears and i left
