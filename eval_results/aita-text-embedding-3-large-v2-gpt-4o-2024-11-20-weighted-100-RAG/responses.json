because he wanted them to be on an equal step. \n\nhe fell deeply in love with her. i met her not long after and she was funny and sweet so we got along great. my brother moved in with her, but just before it happen she said she was sick and had to quit her job. after that he paid for every health appointment to try diagnose her because she has no saving. he also is the only provider of their house since she doesn\u2019t work anymore. she loves to buy expensive items with his card. it has been going on for 7 months and the doctors said they couldn\u2019t find anything. \n\nthese past few month i kept thinking about how it\u2019s weird she has no saving (even though she is supposed to have had a big salary), and he never met anybody from her work. there is no medical proof that she is sick. anyway they went to my house for dinner and she told me she was still feeling too ill to work. 20 minutes later she was talking about the new coat she bought (with his money) and i made a comment about how she wasn\u2019t too sick to shop.\n\nmy brother was very upset and got up to talk to me. i told him my concern that she was a scammer and he said i was an asshole for insulting her and thinking she didn\u2019t love him. they left and he refuse to talk to me anymore. i don\u2019t know if i should apologise. aita ?", "classification": "NTA", "justification": "nta, and make sure

it's ruined our lives. \n\nfirst off he bought several family members(including small children) gifts that  he quickly took back and claimed that weren't deserved. he then offered to arrange and pay for a couple of family get togethers (hired a pavillion, caterers, etc etc) then days before the event demanded we pay a share of the costs that no one ever agreed to and if we refused we were accused of using him for his money. this happened once and we got the money together(my wife and i had to dip into our mortgage deposit fund to pay our share) and the second time we told him to piss off and not go. \n\njust before christmas our sister gave birth(our bil passed away a month prior from an accident) and my wife and i offered to give her our daughters cast off clothes as she was struggling financially. mark bought multiple expensive items(bassinet, cot, rocker, etc etc) for her as gifts then asked her to visit him and his gf with the baby when our sister had only been out of hospital 4 days, she declined and offered to visit when the baby was a month old and he flipped out accusing her of not holding up her side of a nonexistent bargain and went to her house with several friends when we were all supposed to be quarantining and took the stuff he'd bought. \n\nnow he has dumped his gf of 5 years because she asked him why he didn't buy her a christmas present(she bought him the ps5) and he accused her of being a gold digger who only wanted his money. his gf is now living with us as she's high risk due to a lung issue so it would be unsuitable for her to couch surf with friends. mark called me up yesterday and complained about how ever since he'd won the lottery no one wanted to be friends with him and everyone was using him. i started laughing and ripped into him

when me and my twin brother (28) were 2 years old. we both had to see our dad every other weekend but most of the time our step-mum looked after us without him. when we were 13 our mom met our stepdad and they got married a couple of years later. mine and my dads relationship deteriorated and my mum and brothers did. my brother views me as both our parents favourite despite the issues with my dad. \n\nonto the conflict, when we got engaged (we got married nov 2019) my husband and i expected to pay for everything, any contributions would be a gift. my mum and sd ended up gifting almost \u00a33000 which is a lot for them and was hugely appreciated. a couple of other family members contributed, again with many thanks and we put that money towards an incredible honeymoon. we paid for our wedding ourselves as we didn\u2019t want any interference on the details and i\u2019ll admit we went overboard, destination and two wedding dresses, but it was our money to spend how we liked (we make around the same and had similar savings).\n\nmy brother got engaged in nov 2021 and his fianc\u00e9 (20f) approached us all for wedding planning about a week ago and things did not go well. she sat myself, my mum and her mum down and gave a list of expenses/contributions which totalled around \u00a33000 for me (i didn\u2019t see the other lists). i immediately questioned what was happening and thought the whole situation was ridiculous. she said that i had an extravagant wedding and these contributions were the bare minimum. i excused myself to calm down because at that point i was seeing red. i returned and explained i was happy to give her a gift for the wedding at my own discretion and would pay to be in the wedding if she wanted me to but this list of requirements was unacceptable. the kicker here is she then informed me i was not in the wedding, these were contributions as sister of the groom as her sisters would be bridesmaids. the argument escalated and both of us said some awful things. when i called her a  gold digger she burst into tears and i left to avoid dealing with her anymore. \n\nlater my brother came to my house and as soon as i opened the door berated me about everything. all his issues with our parents and me and the way i view his fianc\u00e9 seemed to come out all at once. to be clear i am aware my parents favoured me,i cannot control the way they treated him and all i can do is ensure i am not complicit as an adult. he essentially exploded then left. he then texted me to say he could forgive me for my actions as a child but my treatment of his fianc\u00e9 was too far. i think this whole situation stems from him feeling that my parents contributed to me but not him. only it\u2019s not traditional for the grooms parents to

me. i don't know how i'll feel in five or ten years, but right now i don't see myself ever finding anyone else. i do believe in an afterlife, and i'm pretty much just waiting to see her again,

doing things with my friends within the past 3-4 months. anyways, my friend 'matt' (25m) is having his birthday celebration next weekend and is basically planning to do an at-home theatre kind of thing in his garage with a projector. i told him i'd go.\n\nour friend group (which she was a part of) is really into horror stuff, and i find out a couple days later at his place that they're planning to watch alien (1979). that was rose's favorite movie of all time. like, she could recite it word-for-word, we had matching nostromo stickers for our laptops, and i've lost count of how many times i've watched it with her and how many inside jokes we had about this particular movie. the thought of having to sit through it now that she's dead makes me feel physically sick. i genuinely think it would be too painful for me to stomach.\n\ni pulled matt aside and asked him if we could watch something else and explained why. he said no, he really wanted to watch it. i said that i wouldn't be going if they were watching that movie, and he got upset. he said i couldn't hold onto her forever, that i had to start moving on and 'living my life.' i told him that i *am* living my

the main floor and up the stairs behind it.  she didn\u2019t hear me and i caught her walking straight into my room and rifling through bills on my dresser.  she denied snooping (even though i\u2019d just watched her do it) and said she was just going to use our bathroom because she couldn\u2019t find the other ones. she walked right past the one on the main floor and another one in the upstairs

since she wouldn\u2019t try to get into the rooms and i insisted that she would because she loves to snoop.  we went back and forth and decided to cover the doorknobs in super fine glitter to see if she tried them.  \n\ni did this once before when husband didn\u2019t believe me about the snooping to prove she\u2019d been in the rooms.  last time she ignored the glitter and we didn\u2019t say

still fucked up). he said i'm being a homophobic asshole, and that i don't know how hard it is to come out. he said that if i don't accept him, i'm a bigot. he made mistakes and what not. i said maybe i will forgive him if he improves his behaviour to his wife, and he said he resents her for keeping him from sleeping with men for years. i gave up at this point. my sisters (17&amp;24) both think i'm being homophobic, my mom agrees with me. aita?", "retrieved_docs": [{"text": "AITA for refusing to let my mom(51F) and my sisters (28F,27F) back into my life after they disowned me 6 years ago?\n\nmy mom(51f) and my dad(64m) were married for 26 years, they had three kids, me (30m) and my sisters emily(28f), and rachel (27f). 6 years ago after staying with my dad for 27 years she came out as a lesbian and asked dad for a divorce, it was really unexpected, my parents were always very happy, i didn't see them fighting or anything like that.\n\nmy dad found out that she was seeing a woman for 8 months before she asked for a divorce, it really hurt him, my dad absolutely adored my mom. my mom tried to deny but my dad had proof of her relationship with that woman.\n\nmy dad came from a very wealthy family while my mom came from a very poor background, so when they got married 32 years ago my mom signed a prenup, the prenup had a really harsh infidelity clause, which means that when my dad was able to prove that my mom cheated on him my mom (who was a sahm for most of their marriage) didn't get any alimony and the property division really favorited my dad (80% for him 20% for mom).\n\nduring the divorce, my mom and my sisters were making my life and my dad lives a living hell, they were claiming that dad was being too harsh on mom and ''punishing her for being gay'', while i think that the outcome of the divorce was harsh on her. my mom and my sisters accused me of ''taking dad's side'' while i was just trying to stay out of this whole mess, i tried several times to explain that i wasn't taking dad's side, but they refused to listen to me and after the divorce was finished they cut me off their lives, they refused to talk to me and my sisters disowned my dad.\n\nit was hard, i was really close with my sisters before that, and they cut me off and didn't even seem to care, after a lot of therapy for this, i eventually stopped trying and forced myself to move on.\n\nmy wife gave birth to a beautiful baby girl 2 weeks ago, we were both really happy and my wife posted a photo of us with our daughter 10 days ago.\n\nthem last week, my mom after ignoring me for all this time called me and she was actually mad that i didn't i let her know that she was a grandma and she was making plans to stay with me and my wife to help with her granddaughter (?) i told her that she shouldn't expect a free pass to my life after ignoring me for so long, she started crying and i hang up.\n\nthe next day my sisters called me, telling me that i was again being too harsh on mom, that i should move on, and that they forgive me for how i treated them (???), that they were excited to meet her, i told them the exact same thing that they ignored me (and dad, my dad got into a deep depression after my sisters disowned him, it was really bad), and that i don't want them around me and especially not my daughter, i hang up after that.\n\nnow i'm receiving tons of calls, texts, and even emails(?) from people my mom and my sisters, and even my mom's wife (?) who accused me of being homophobic.

did my best to fit in (star wars movies, harry potter, etc), i took my first opportunity to leave the area for school. i went to fit and got a degree in fashion design.  i always loved making my own clothes. to frame it one way... i made my prom dress from my own pattern, and my family smiled politely. my sister threw together a harry potter costume and the picture is hanging on the walls.\n\nwell, sis had kids a while back. i sent polite gifts, including a quilt to be handed down. sis received them warmly, but i found out she doesn't use the quilt because the room is \"harry potter\" themed.\n\ndue to covid, i ended up moving back closer to home into a condo i'd been renting out (tenants were not evicted or anything). once sis found out, she got really excited and started making all kinds of plans. i was thrilled because i thought *she* wanted to spend more time with me.\n\nexcept the plans were like... i take the kids to the zoo, i take them to the park, i take them for ice cream, the aquarium, etc, so sis can have some time to herself and relax, play video games, etc. i inquired about when she and i would spend time together, and she actually said \"it's not like we have anything in common we can do together.\"\n\ni was really hurt by this, and declined her requests for me to basically babysit her kids. she asked me why, and didn't i want to be the cool aunt, and this is where i think i'm the asshole.\n\ni said \"i don't know, it's not like i have anything in common with them that we can do together. sounds like you want an unpaid babysitter.\"\n\nshe was shocked and went stomping to mom and dad, who immediately took her side and told me that i should be thankful to spend time with the kids. i said why, it's not like anyone in the family has *ever* made it a point to spend time with me doing something *i'd* enjoy. she told me that if i'd tried harder to be more like there rest of them, instead of \"chasing popularity and doing my nails\" maybe i would have more in common with them.\n\ni'm lost now, because on the one hand, i don't think i was wrong to decline being a free sitter for my sister. but maybe my mom is right and i've been a shitty member of the family because i couldn't just get into star wars and all that.\n\n**", "classification": "NTA", "justification": "nta - never the arsehole. your sister is

have a 1 bedroom apartment, but according to them they had 'no other options' so of course i invited them over and bought a blow-up mattress for the living room.\n\nfor the first month things were manageable, although admittedly cramped. then my brother told me that sleeping on the mattress was giving him back pains, so he asked if he could buy a small double bed for the living room. the living room is by far the biggest room i have, so i told him that would be fine as long as there was still room for my couch/tv/bookshelves.  the living room is also connected to my kitchen in an open plan style, so i reminded my brother to leave walking space around the bed.\n\nit's now been 2+ months and things have gotten a lot worse. when they first moved in, i would still use the living room every day to unwind on the couch after work. now whenever i go in, there's a strange vibe like i'm intruding. my brother and his wife are often sitting in bed together when i go in (i always knock) and stare at me pointedly until i leave. sometimes when i sit down they will directly ask me for some 'alone time' and say they would like the room to themselves.\n\nthis came to a head yesterday when my sister-in-law messaged me with a 'timetable' she'd made of when it would be 'a good time' for me to use the living room. the timetable basically says that they will allow me into the room for an hour each evening, plus 20 minutes around mealtimes.\n\ni basically shut her down instantly and told her there was no way i'd be following the timetable since in the end it's my apartment. she sent me back

that night, but when i got home neither my brother/sil were talking to me, so he's clearly just as pissed. today an amazon parcel arrived for my brother with a lock for the living room door, which i

learned how to pronounce each others\u2019 last names, despite everyone\u2019s last name having multiple syllables and complicated spellings. none of them have a name like \u201csmith\u201d or \u201cjohnson\u201d - they\u2019re all names that most wouldn\u2019t be able to pronounce on the first try.\n\nnow, i made a concerted effort to learn everyone\u2019s names and they literally don\u2019t give a shit about mine. so i called them out and said that they seem unwilling to learn my name because i\u2019m different from them. they took this as me calling them racist, and now, none

me\u2014 i\u2019ve never really liked it, it\u2019s weird, and it gets mispronounced. a lot. it\u2019s really not hard to pronounce, it\u2019s just the fact that i\u2019m always the first person

too. i knew for a fact that she was capable of saying it. \n\nanyways, i recently got accepted for a new job, and i put in my notice (to a lot of passive aggression, especially since they were grossly understaffed and i was the one they were shoving their extra work onto), and decided i would be a little petty. i stopped responding to \u201csarah,\u201d only staring at her until she said my real name. she wasn\u2019t thrilled, but she did say my name.\n\ni know it\u2019s partially my fault that i didn\u2019t assert myself from the beginning, but i also feel that someone\u2019s name is really personal, and at least making an attempt to say it is basic human decency/respect. however, today was my last day of work, and my manager called me into her office to basically interrogate me. it was full of really unprofessional ranting, along with personal digs at me. when i brought up the name issue, she went on the defensive, saying she was \u201cjust joking\u201d and that i\u2019m \u201coverly sensitive\u201d because she jokes with everyone. basically called me unlikable and rude. i asked her if she would like it if i decided i didn\u2019t like her name, and called her

they were going to sleep. fianc\u00e9  and i have separate rooms. fianc\u00e9  has a queen while my room has two twins so it can be converted into a guest room if needed. i put the kid in my fiance's son's room, the couple in mine, and i moved into fiance's room like usual they went all quiet when i showed them the room, but i didnt really think anything of it. later, cousin knocked on my door and asked to switch rooms because they werent comfortable sleeping separately. \n\nnow, my fianc\u00e9 has expensive tech stuff for work in his room. the kid is hyperactive and in their room all day.

about that tomorrow but no no no, it had to be tonight. well, it was late and there was no way but he thought that it would only take me a couple of hours. i said,' wait, you're helping right?'  but he said it was rude to ask a guest to fix something that was a result of my own 'lack of forethought'. \n\ni just closed the door on him and went to sleep. next morning, the wife was irritable through breakfast ( she tossed all the uncooked stuff i'd left out into the trash without even asking me- including half a loaf of fresh homemade brioche ) and i could hear them having whispered arguments. in the afternoon he said they were going to stay with his friend and left.\n\ni just thought good riddance and forgot about it until my grandma called today and said i'd ruined their marriage and needed

apparently caused l to have a meltdown and tell her mother, who came into the kitchen and had the audacity to try to force m to play with l until my mother told her to back off. p then proceeded to call m a bully. my mum stopped her and told her to leave the room, which she did, and that was the scene when we arrived home. my mum pleaded with me not to make an issue of it, but i stormed in to confront p (not in front of the children). p had some long rant about how i was teaching my child to be a bully and that this was especially hurtful to l as she is bullied at school and that i should teach my daughter to be kind to people with 'special needs'. i had never heard of l having special needs prior to this conversation - though it wouldn't surprise me - but i told p that not only did that not change the situation, m wasn't 'bullying' l in the first place, she just politely declined to do something she didn't want to do, and that it would be a cold day in hell before i taught my young daughter that anyone can demand or cajole her into doing things with them when she doesn't want to. i also told her in no uncertain terms that she should not even think of overstepping boundaries with my child in the future.\n\nobviously, the whole family has since weighed in. the general consensus is that while p reacted in a way that was totally unacceptable, giving m a permission

parties and had 5 different flavored cakes. each time he pulls them apart by hand, picks out seemingly random pieces, and eats about half. when people start with the \"good cake\" comments he never says anything and even made a disgusted face after eating one of them. i was admittedly heated after that, but my wife (also 28f) told me to make it more clear that there was an alternative cake and to focus on the people who did enjoy it.\n\nbil's birthday is coming up at the end of august and yesterday i had the following text exchange with my sister (35f):\n\nsis: (bil) told me to tell you to make him a carrot cake. birthday is coming up if you forgot.\n\nme: i didn't forget at all! it's a little far out for me to be planning, unless we're celebrating earlier?\n\nsis: nothing early. carrot cake though.\n\nme: we had that at dad's party and (bil) didn't seem to like it. sure that's what he wants?\n\nsis: wouldn't have asked if he didn't want it. i think he hates it less than your others.\n\nme: thanks :) i know he likes strawberries. maybe i could do a strawberry and cream cake for him? he doesn't have to choose from the ones he's had.\n\nsis: just make the carrot cake.

established.\n\na few years later, my mom passed due to cancer, and i became libby's guardian. mom left me the house entirely, and split her savings into some for me and some for a college fund for libby. her jewelry was split evenly amongst me, libby and roxanne.\n\nlibby got into college, and her fund was enough to cover the tuition, but not living expenses. i reached out to roxanne to ask if she could help. she is very well off due to her profession and having no debt from my parents paying for her college. she said no. okay, fair enough. however she got incredibly angry with me that i would ask after inheriting 'everything' and told me i was greedy and money hungry. i pointed out that the house was to ensure libby got to stay where she grew up, and the money mom left me was meant to help with related expenses. she told me never to ask her for money again, called libby a bunch of nasty names, saying she always hated her, that libby was the favorite child, that she (roxanne) got neglected after libby was born (not true). she cut us off after that.\n\nabout 4 years have passed since then. recently she reached out, asking if we could talk, and i said no. i am perfectly happy without her, libby is doing well, my aunt and i split the expenses to get her through college. it was definitely a bit hard for us, but worth it. however roxanne has been telling our aunt that we're

which then crashed into me, sending me crashing into two different cars and then ultimately into an embankment. my car was mangled and my leg was crushed, completely destroyed, and it had to be amputated. i also lost a couple fingers (the tip of one and all of another). i'm also left with some gnarly scars that used to bother me but i'm learning to deal with them. i got a couple different insurance payouts and some pain and suffering money in addition to my medical bills being paid and with my money i purchased a custom-made leg to take the place of the one i lost. when i have pants and shoes on you can hardly tell unless you're really looking. i still limp but some days i don't have as pronounced a limp.\n\nearlier today i went to the store with my boyfriend, my sister, her

my ptsd but i'm doing well there now as well. so, i drove us, and because of my injuries (in addition to my leg i also have chronic hip, neck, and back pain, and some issues with my lungs from the time spent intubated in a medically-induced coma that led to pneumonia) i have a handicap placard for my car. i have trouble walking without getting tired so it really helps to park close to the door.

around. he was still on the other aisle when i pulled in so i didn't cut him off or anything and had no way of knowing he wanted the spot.\n\nhe parked in the yellow stripe zone and got out and immediately began confronting me about stealing a space from people who actually need it, how i'm just some kid who has no respect for those who are truly sick and suffering. he then ordered me to move. my group was urging me to just walk way but this has happened before and once the police were even called. i'm sick of people thinking that just because i'm young that i don't have a legit need for a little extra consideration. i said \"okay\", and went to the car and got in like i was going to drive off. i was wearing a skirt and leggings so it wasn't quite obvious at first but when i sat down i took my leg off and showed it to the man, including my stump. i then asked him if it was okay if i still parked there. he walked away calling me disgusting and rude and said i could have just

to talk about.\n\ni went home for the holidays earlier this year with my fiance, who is also vegan. my older brothers (26 and 28) still live at home with my parents. my fiance is also a professional chef (i'm an okay cook but usually follow his lead), and we offered to cook a nice dinner for the whole family.  my middle brother is a picky eater, but we made foods that are generally pretty well liked by the whole family. we made fresh homemade pasta and rolls, my fiance made a delicious sauce with lots of veggies, and a big salad. we served the food and everyone agreed that it looked and smelled delicious.\n\nthen my brother goes to the fridge and gets a big block of cheese and starts grating it over his pasta. i asked him if he would please stop, we were trying to make a vegan meal everyone could enjoy, and purposefully hadn't put in any foods he didn't like. he said he doesn't like to eat pasta without cheese (???) i said that since we had put in a lot of effort into cooking and it was disrespectful when we had intentionally made the food to be vegan, in an attempt to show how good vegan cooking could be. he got huffy and said i was being too controlling. my parents

quietly whispered that it was fine and i'd just eat later. she started crying.\n\nmy father, who is more of a meat and potatoes guy, latched on to this and made it about \"not letting his daughter

shellfish allergy as well. the first 3 i named are very serious and have landed me in hospital in the past became of cross contamination, so i'm really weary. i talked to my brother about if there would be anything safe for me to eat at the event, but because they're using a local neighbourhood ladies business as the catering service instead of something professional i did not feel comfortable enough that there was absolutely zero chance of me having a reaction, especially because the allergens were ingredients in many of the dishes. it felt too risky, so i said i'd bring my own food and he

was a vegan wedding was the main focus.\n\nin my eyes, i bought my own food because they weren't able to provide me with something which was safe to eat, and it's not like i brought a steak. i had 2

my childhood spending money they didn\u2019t have on my siblings, so by the time i hit my teenage years, i realized i was probably going to have to fend for myself financially when i turn 18. i started babysitting and doing odd jobs around my neighborhood when i was 14, and eventually got part-time jobs during the school year. \n\n\nby the time i was 16, i was working three jobs in the summer and two in addition to school. when my parents told me they couldn\u2019t pay for college, i\u2019d already earned enough (along with scholarships) to be able to put myself through college and have plenty left over. i\u2019ve continued to work during the school year, and have been able to make money during quarantine by tutoring online. \n\n\nthe issue began a few months ago, when my eldest sister (29f) got married. my parents spent 30 grand on her wedding, taking out a second mortgage to do so. to make matters worse, my dad was furloughed 6 days after the wedding. they\u2019d

all other loan options, both from family and the bank. i figured they would text me, ask me to loan them a few thousand, and promise to pay it back when they could figure things out. i was absolutely willing to pitch in a few thousand, and had even considered giving them some of my tutoring jobs so they could make some extra cash. \n\n\ni was not, however, expecting them to demand i give them all the money (close to $40,000) i\u2019d made from the ages of 14-18. \n\n\nthe exact statement my mom had made was \u201cyou made that money under our roof. we were the ones who allowed you to work, so you only have it because of us anyway...we bought you food and clothes for 18 years. that money is only a fraction of what you owe us...\u201d and so on.\n\n\ni said that food, clothes, and shelter

wouldn\u2019t have the life i have today. i said they were being ridiculous, and hung up. \n\n\nsince that day, both (along with two of my siblings) have continuously hounded me about giving them what is \u201crightfully theirs.\u201d my siblings, who have never been asked to give them money, are still professing that it\u2019s my job as their kid to take care of them. i told them they

asked if she deleted the videos she first said she had no idea then admitted she did it \"accidently\" i asked her to explain and her story didn't make sense. i told her that those weren't just my gf's videos. those were family memories that i cherished so much. i lost it and she said that i should never hurt her feelings and start an argument like that. she said she already told me she had no problem with keeping those videos and that i'm being harsh on her.\n\ni asked since she said she had no problem and that she was understanding of how important this is to me then why she deleted those

kindergarten. while surviving without her paycheck is very difficult considering the area we live in, she was adamant that this would be best for our daughter as she had read developmental books saying that children should spend their fundamental developmental years with their mothers. as a result of this, i'm the sole breadwinner and i work two jobs to support us, one of which is a manual labour job. \n\nwhen i come home from work i'm exhausted, and i just want there to be dinner on the table and for the house to be clean. this has been our arrangement since our daughter has been born - while we share childcare, she is responsible for all other household duties.\n\nlately, my wife has admitted that she's resentful of the fact that i don't help out more at home. while i'm constantly stressed and tired from work, she expects me to share the household responsibilities as well, such as cooking a few times a week, washing the dishes when she cooks, doing the grocery shopping with a list, babysitting for full evenings while she goes out with friends, and so on. i myself don't have the pleasure of going out drinking with friends either and her requests seem unfair. she has all day to do these things and they are her job.\n\ni told her how i felt about it and now she's giving me the cold shoulder complaining about how it's because i have a toxic masculinity view of household duties. this isn't true. if the roles were reversed and she was the one constantly working, i wouldn't dream of asking her to help with running the household on top of that.\n\naita or is she being

ten years since. while he ended up going into it, i stayed in the liberal arts track and ended up doing non-profit work after college when i realized i didn\u2019t actually want to be a schoolteacher. just to say that we always assumed he\u2019d out-earn me by a considerable margin, though when he made more i always insisted we split things evenly to avoid potential resentment down the road.\n\ni\u2019ve had sort of a non-linear career path, but ended up switching to the corporate world. to make a long story short, my liberal arts degree and time doing non-profit work gave me a lot of skills that enable me to really excel professionally in some more niche areas. i recently started a new job as a consultant, making way more than i\u2019d ever anticipated. when i got the offer, i told tim that the pay was \u201camazing\u201d, but he didn\u2019t ask about the actual amount and i didn\u2019t want to be braggy about it, especially since i was fairly sure it was above his current income.\n\nwell we just put in an application for a new place, and in the process of having to submit our paystubs it\u2019s become obvious that i make roughly 30% more than he does now. i expected him to think that was cool, since he\u2019s a feminist and has always been super supportive of my career. but instead he\u2019s started to make increasingly harsh jabs about how i \u201ccheated the system\u201d to get where i am, that no english lit major makes more than a cyber security professional without cheating somehow.\n\nhis major point is that i got my first job out of nepotism, which set me up to \u201ctrample\u201d more qualified people who didn\u2019t have the same advantages. it\u2019s true that i got my first post-college job after being referred by a sorority sister, but it was for non-profit work making 22k/yr, not exactly at somebody\u2019s daddy\u2019s firm. he also points out that at my first corporate job, i snagged a big promotion after volunteering to take on

got some lucky opportunities to shape my career around my original creative interest, and now am at a place where going back to school to get a grad degree in my passion is not only affordable, but something that would absolutely put me ahead in my career and allow me to steer it more towards projects i find compelling. going back to school is especially important to me because i spent my whole life feeling stupid, feeling like things were so much harder for me than for everyone else, which i learned last year is actually because of undiagnosed adhd and dyscalculia (like dyslexia but with

of full time college in order to afford my education, his parents paid for his. he first went into the boring finance job before realizing his passion was in social work, with his parents paying for his grad school in social work. he currently does financial stuff for a non-profit and is enjoying his own dream field. while our relationship is generally great, the one sticky point is his belief that my adhd-fueled executive dysfunction and messiness makes me \"lazy\", which deeply bothers me because i feel i've worked very hard to get where i am in life. harder than he has.\n\nso i told him that responding to my joy about getting closer to a life dream by literally calling it a \"useless racket\" was nasty and insensitive. he got upset with me and insisted i was again twisting his words

you're literally sexting your dad pretending to be a 50 year old\". she told me to fuck off and hasn't texted since.\n\nanyways, am i the asshole for suggesting this in the first place? i thought it would be a funny prank where my friend would reveal that it was her the whole time like.. the next day, but she's still doing this \"prank\" two months later. her and her dad live under the same roof.", "classification": "ESH", "justification": "esh. \n\nsuggesting to catfish her dad was a terrible idea. what did you think would happen?\n\nthe fact she went through with it requires a whole other counseling session."}, {"text": "AITA For Effectively Ruining My Sisters Life Because Of What She Did\n\nso, i\u2019ve (f20) had a boyfriend, let\u2019s call him john, john (m20) and i started dating when we were 17. i have a big family, i have my mom (f53) my dad (m55) my older twin sisters that are 34, and my younger sister (f19). my sisters both have husbands and kids and my younger sister lives at home and works for the family business. i live in a condo with boyfriend. he\u2019s always been close with my family. around 2 weeks ago i was ordering post mates on my boyfriends phone and he got a message from my younger sister. i was feeling nosy and opened up their message thread. for 2 months they\u2019ve been hooking up and sending nudes. in that moment i flipped out and took screenshots, i sent them to myself and deleted the evidence. i acted like nothing happened and luckily the next day john was gonna go visit his mom in another state. the next day after he left to drive to his mom i sent them to my mom, my dad and both my other sisters. my whole family was disgusted. that day i left the condo because it\u2019s in his name so i didn\u2019t have any commitment legally to it. then my sisters husbands helped move me into my parents house. it all happened in a day and when my sister got to my parents house all her stuff was outside the house. she tried coming in and my dad went outside and started screaming at her. my other sisters both went outside and they all yelled at her, and told her that she was a disappointment to the family. my dad fired her on the spot.

months. our family gatherings have always been very meat heavy so i told her i would bring a couple vegan dishes to share like some dip, a salad and maybe bread or dinner rolls. my aunt doesn\u2019t jormslly let anyone bring any dishes to her place because her autistic son is very allergic to peanuts and she\u2019s worried about cross contamination. i thought she\u2019d be okay with this as long as i was super careful, didn\u2019t make anything with nuts and her son didn\u2019t eat what i brought anyways but she wasn\u2019t comfortable with the idea. i then suggested i could bring storebought dishes that were but-fre instead. she also wasn\u2019t comfortable with this. i asked her what she was making for christmas eve so maybe i could help her convert some of it to be vegan so i could eat and she said that sounded stressful. \n\nat this point i was like okay aunt jamie won\u2019t let me bring anything vegan for me to eat, but she also won\u2019t cook anything vegan. i can\u2019t even

famous singer perform next month in a nearby city. she also happens to like this singer so i asked her if she wanted to go with me as a date. i said i can book us a hotel room and we can spend the night together. she said she'd love to go, but only as friends. she says she's alright with us splitting a hotel room as long as it has two beds. she told me she doesn't feel ready to date anyone at the moment, and she doesn't do flings either, so unfortunately we can only be platonic friends. i said i'll think about it. i was quite hurt because honestly i don't have much experience with rejection, and i was annoyed that she turned me down. \n\ntoday, i asked my female coworker to go with me to the concert as a date. she immediately said yes and seemed quite excited about it although she admitted that she never listened to any of their songs. still, i'm taking her out for drinks on friday. but just now, the friend who i asked originally asked if we were still on for the concert. i told her honestly that i already asked another woman, and she seemed disappointed but dropped the subject.\n\nwhen i told my sister about what happened, she said i'm being really douchy. she says her friend is a huge fan of the singer and i should take her instead of my coworker who doesn't even like the band but only wants to go because she likes me. i said she can't understand because she's not a dude. because let's me honest, if i had the choice between going out with a girl who only wants to be my \"friend\" versus a girl who is super into me and wants to take things to the next level, then obviously i'm taking the second one. aita for just being honest about what i want?\n\n**edit**: because a lot of the hang up is over the hotel room thing: yes i would have been fine if the first girl agreed to go with me as a date, but wanted separate hotel beds/rooms. nowhere do i even say that we have to share a bed...\n\nbut the part where she says she\u2019s not ready to date anyone essentially means she is not interested in me. she likely said she\u2019ll go with me as friends just to be nice and not hurt my feelings. so why would i make the experience awkward for the both of us when i could bring along someone who actually is interested in dating me? **edit over**", "retrieved_docs": [{"text": "AITA for inviting a friend to a concert after my (23F) boyfriend (25M)

bummed but he kind of sidestepped and started suggesting we look at other concerts to go to. i was adamant that i still wanted to go to this concert. another friend of mine has also listened to this

wouldn't enjoy the experience. i did end up inviting her, but decided not to buy the tickets as i felt so bummed out about the whole situation. she never responded. he later on asked me if i invited her, and i told him that i did but didn't follow through with buying the tickets. then he spam texted me about how upset he was over the entire situation and that he feels like he was traded out.\n\ni

(we did ask if it was okay if i brought him and she said yes)\n\nmy sister needs to have everything planned pretty much to the minute. when we eat, when and where we go out, when we come back, tv time etc. i\u2019m used to it because it\u2019s how we grew up. my bf knows about it and has been very supportive, listening to me explaining her triggers etc. and last week i caught him googling her special interest so he can talk to her about it. he\u2019s incredibly sweet and i feel so lucky.\n\nhere\u2019s the problem however: we\u2019re both very spontaneous people. i didn\u2019t even know this about myself until i moved out but i like not planning things and just improvising and my bf is the same. on weekends during breakfast usually one of us will go \u2018hey want to do x?\u2019 and then we go. will we be home before dinner? will we stay out all night? who knows, not us! we just do what we feel like in the moment. for this trip we (or well i) made a list of all the places i want to show him and what we want to do but neither of us became happy when we were trying to turn it into a schedule in order to notify my sister when we leave and what time we\u2019ll be back even if it\u2019s just a walk around the neighborhood. i usually only go home for a weekend or so but now it\u2019s two of us for ten days (we stay until after new years) and we just felt really restricted.\n\nso we came up with the solution to stay at a hotel. that way we only have to decide what days/times we\u2019ll be at my family\u2019s place and the rest of the time we can do whatever we want. that way we won\u2019t cause my sister distress and it stays fun for us. i thought we made the right decision but since i\u2019ll be out of the country i celebrated with my friends here this week and they all said that i was rude and a bad daughter for not staying with my parents like a normal person and my dad told me my mom is upset because she was hoping for more time with me (we planned this in august already but she misses me a lot especially with the pandemic and stuff).\n\nso now i\u2019m second guessing our choice. am i a bad daughter?", "classification": "NTA", "justification": "nta. you\u2019re acting like a very considerate daughter. there is no easy solution for a situation like yours and so you came up with a fair compromise so that no one has to suffer. talk to your mom directly (not through your dad) and let her know that you are going to see her plenty and make sure to spend as much time with her as you can. best of luck!"}, {"text": "AITA for choosing to leave town for Christmas due to my families rules?\n\ni(26m) moved back home with family earlier this year to finish what's left of my school and move back out in the next month or two. only problem is, my family is very religious and strict. no cooking after 10pm(when my father goes to sleep) because it wakes him up, despite my class schedule being night and therefore i'm up all night. no friends coming over unless its to do wholesome things and even then if he hears them curse he yells and corrects them. if i go out with a friend, or my friend thats drunk needs a place to stay, they say they cant stay here(i know, very christian-like from a religious family). essentially, textbook control issues.\n\nanyways, when i first moved back i was allowed to have my longtime girlfriend sleep over if i slept on the couch. my father slowly changed that to complaining if shes here for more than a day or two because if i sleep on the couch it \"disrupts his day\". now they have officially banned her from staying over - stating if she wants to stay with someone in town, her brother lives close enough by and she can stay there. this led to me essentially saying that i will be out of town with my girlfriend and her family then for the holidays. since then, my mom has texted me on several occasions telling me that she is \"more disappointed than upset\" with me for being petty and going against my father and simple house rules. i told her that they enable his control issues by not saying anything due to fear of being lashed out on and if she wants to be upset with someone, look at her husband. aita?", "classification": "NTA", "justification": "nta.  you should always spend christmas with the people you want to spend christmas with."}, {"text": "AITA for staying in a hotel because my parents refuse to let me sleep in the same bed as my partner when we visit.\n\ni have been with my so for about 8 years.  we live together, have several kids, and for all practical purposes are a married couple.  for personal reasons though we decided marriage is not the best route for us at the time and are still just partners.  my parents refuse to let us share a bed or room when we visit their house, so for the last 5 years we have never visited for more than a day.  my parents recently moved across the country and are having a huge family party to celebrate their 30th anniversary.  \n\ni was talking to my mom about plans and she said my sister and her newly wed would be sharing one guest room, my kids could have the other guest room, my partner could have the couch and i could sleep on the futon in their bedroom.  i told them that it would work better if the kids slept on the couch and floor downstairs and me and my partner could share the bedroom.\n\nmy mom said that wouldn't work.  i knew why, but said why not.  she said well you're not married of course.  i hate to make their special weekend about me but i had to retort that we would not be staying with them if they would not let us share a room while allowing my sister to share a room with her husband.  i said it also further adds salt to the wound because it delegitmizes our relationship to my kids.

their house, their rules, and we\u2019ve respected their wishes in the past, but i don\u2019t like it. it feels infantilizing. plus, we\u2019re moving in together in a month and they know that. anyway, the same room thing is annoying but not a dealbreaker on its own. however\u2026\n-\tthe bed they have me sleep on is so uncomfortable. it\u2019s a twin cot in a tiny little room which is fine, but the mattress is the worst. it\u2019s so uncomfortable that i can barely sleep so i\u2019m always tired. plus, every time i sleep on that mattress my back ends up killing me for days afterwards. they also refuse to turn their ac on and that little windowless room gets so hot at night. i started bringing an electric fan whenever we visit in the summer which helps a tiny bit but not much. and then my boyfriend ends up having to sleep on the pullout couch in the den, which he hates because\u2026\n-\this dad is a very early riser and is usually up at 4:30 am, blasting music and singing along at top volume while he makes coffee and eats breakfast. he doesn\u2019t stop doing this when there are guests in the house, and even though i sleep upstairs i can hear everything like it\u2019s inches away. \n-\tmy bf\u2019s siblings and their families will also be there. between them they have 5 little kids. i love the kids but they are also loud early risers. \n\nso for this long weekend, i decided to book a room at a hotel that\u2019s less than a 10-minute walk to his parents\u2019 home. i talked with my bf before i did it and he said he said he thought it was a good idea, but he said that he would still stay at his parents\u2019 house (on the cot i usually sleep on). \n\nwell, he was at my place last night and his mom facetimed and we told her i\u2019d be staying at a hotel. she was really offended. she said that it was rude of me to turn down a free bed in their home and accused me of not wanting to see them or spend time with them. \n\nto my bf\u2019s credit, he defended me and told her that all i was planning on doing was sleeping at the hotel, i\u2019d still be spending pretty much every waking moment with the family. but she kept saying things like \u201cwhat, our house isn\u2019t good enough for you, op?\u201d \n\ni told her that i just want to be comfortable when i sleep and that it wasn\u2019t anything personal. she eventually said \u201cfine, whatever, see you tomorrow\u201d and then hung up abruptly. \n\nso then she must\u2019ve complained about me to the rest of the family because this morning, bf\u2019s sister texted him and said \u201clook, i know that bed sucks but it\u2019s only two nights, can\u2019t she just stay there to keep the peace?\u201d my bf continued to defend me but now i\u2019m dreading this entire weekend.", "classification": "NTA", "justification": "nta -
