However, your approach was not malicious, and it sounds like you both communicated about it afterward. The ribbing from friends seems unnecessary, as it doesn\u2019t contribute positively to the situation. Overall, it appears that you were trying to show love in your own way, even if it didn\u2019t align with her expectations.", "query": "AITA for buying my gf a blender instead of the necklace she wanted for our anniversary?\n\nbefore i start i\u2019d like to say that my gf and i are both women. we are lesbians. i say this to hopefully preempt the \u2018typical man\u2019 comments. \n\nthis happened last month but my best friend and hers are still giving me shit about it. we had our one year anniversary. i asked what she wanted and she told me just something romantic, a little necklace or something cute. while browsing around on amazon i found an emulsion blender and it pinged in my head. my gf loves cooking and always talks about all the gadgets she wants. plus she made homemade tomato sauce and i remember her complaining how hard it was to make the sauce smooth cause she didn\u2019t have an emulsion blender. i\u2019m a very practical gift giver, i like to give things people will use so i bought it and was super excited to give it to her. \n\nthe day rolls around and she gives me a bottle of whiskey i\u2019ve had my eye on for ages but could never justify the cost. i was so hyped and encouraged my gf to open hers. she opened it and her face kinda falls and she goes \u2018oh\u2026 an emulsion blender\u2026?\u2019 and i told her i remembered her talking about all the kitchen gadgets she wanted and was so excited to give it to her. she kept her cool but told me while she appreciated the thought she was a little upset that it wasn\u2019t jewelry. i was confused so she explained that she felt anniversary\u2019s should be more about romantic/sentimental gifts versus practical, that she appreciated it greatly but couldn\u2019t lie to me that she wished it had been the necklace she pointed out to me online (it was nothing fancy, a $30 mushroom necklace). i shared my woes with my friend and my friend thought it was hilarious that i was so inept, and that he understood why my gf was upset with her gift. gf\u2019s best friend also got wind of the situation and has been ribbing me with telling my gf to get back to the kitchen jokes etc. my gf and i are fine but i know she was disappointed, and she ended up buying the necklace herself a week after i gave her the blender. so aita for giving my gf a practical gift versus the necklace she wanted?", "top_comment": "yta\n\nso i get you're a lesbian but wow, this is like tv sitcom man action. you might as well have bought her a bowling ball with your name on it.", "top_comment_classification": "YTA", "predicted_classification": "NTA", "predicted_response_toxicity": {"label": "BENIGN", "score": 0.9992833733558655}, "true_response_toxicity": {"label": "TOXIC", "score": 0.6523698568344116}}, {"response": "YTA. While it's understandable that you want to bond with your son, suggesting that your wife switch to formula to facilitate that is not a reasonable solution. Breastfeeding is a significant commitment for many mothers, and your insistence on being present during feeding sessions seems to disregard her needs and comfort. Additionally, your approach to the situation appears to prioritize your feelings over her well-being and the established breastfeeding routine. It's important to find a balance that respects both parents' roles without undermining your wife's choices and experiences as a new mother.", "query": "AITA? For suggesting that my wife switch to Formula so I could have more time with our son?\n\nhey y'all. read carefully before giving judgement!.\n\nso my wife (f24) and i (m27) had our son 3 months ago. luckily as new parents we've had less issues compared to others in our family but what really created an issue was the fact that my wife gets wayyyy more bonding time with my son than i do. she breastfeeds and doesn't let me come anywhere near her while she's doing it claiming she was already in pain and i was making her stressed out with my behavior. she'd promise to let me have my bonding time once she's done but she takes a long time feeding and then the baby goes to sleep so i get pretty much,...almost, no time to bond with him.\n\n\nit all came to head for me last night after my wife told me to leave the room while she was feeding our son cause i was '''bothering,,, her and making her feel '''stressed out,,, with my ''\"judgemental,,, comments but i was just making sure she was feeding our son properly since she's dealing with stress and possible ppd and so i had to **(not under doctor's recommendation though but following my mom's advice)** be present in every feeding session to make sure nothing goes wrong and...like i said before maybe get a chance to bond with my son but it didn't end well and i refused to leave the room. she tried to unload on me about how unsupportive and difficult i was being but i told her she was wrong to exclude me and take away my attempt at bonding with my son and that it's only fair that i get to have equal time she has with him and suggested that she switch to formula so she has no way of keeping me excluded and again so i could get 50% of the time she has with him. she called me unreasonable and explained that even though i'm the parent too she as a mother is essentially what our son needs and relies on so her role is more important and she gets more time than i do simply because she's the mother. .....then she explained that my request was ridiculous because she is blessed to have almost no issues with bf and switching to formula was absolutely uncalled for and can not be afforded right now but i disagreed and argued that she left me no choice and that she needs to respect whatever decision i make regarding our son even if she doesn't like it and doesn't necessary agree with it but she argued back saying i'm delusional to think she'll just switch to formula to fix my hurt '''feefees,,, and even accused me of making this request so mom could meddle in and start feeding our son formula and have sleepovers since she was against her breastfeeding from the start due to how weak she was before. this really had me...kind of...lose my cool ngl. i told her that couldn't be further from the truth. matter fact, i strongly believe her refusal to consider switching to formula is mainly to spite mom not because she thinks my request was '''unreasonable,,,\n\nlong story short, we kept going back and forth on this argument and she told me to drop it but i refused because in my opinion she's being selfish by how she's treating me as the other parent.", "top_comment": "yta. big time. your wife isn\u2019t taking a long time \nto feed the baby - the baby takes that long to feed. \nyour controlling, selfish behaviour is no doubt contributing to your wife\u2019s stress. \n\nread carefully: when your wife and child are at their most vulnerable, you are putting your wants ahead of their needs. you are absolutely the asshole.  you should immediately seek help from a psychologist to understand why you are behaving in this way.", "top_comment_classification": "YTA", "predicted_classification": "YTA", "predicted_response_toxicity": {"label": "BENIGN", "score": 0.9991670846939087}, "true_response_toxicity": {"label": "TOXIC", "score": 0.7921063899993896}}]
