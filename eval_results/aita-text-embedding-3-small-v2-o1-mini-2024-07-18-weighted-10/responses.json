private if she can disperse the chores more fairly amongst her kids and myself but she said no. her reason being that we're siblings and that as a uncle, i should step up for my nephew and niece and naturally, i'm expected to do more.\n\ni reminded her that her oldest child is older than me (18f) yet she doesn't get as much chores as i do. instead her and my nephew (13m) just sit down and watch tv or play games while i have to do practically everything. she repeated what she had said earlier and told me that this shouldn't be a topic for debate.\n\ni got mad and told her that if that's the case, i won't be doing any more chores until she reconsiders. she then called me an \"ungrateful brat\" and angrily said that she's the one giving me a roof to live under, it's her house and threatened that if i keep this behaviour up, she'll kick me out to live with someone else.\n\ni didn't know what to say but instead looked at the floor for a while before going back to whatever chore i was assigned to do in the first place. we haven't spoken to each other since. this wouldn't even be an issue if i was the oldest out of us kids, but i find it unfair that majority of the chores are

theirs. or if i had plans and they wanted to go someplace, i had to cancel my plans. it's my parents fault. but more than once i tried talking to them about how i deserved to have my life and do my

spending all of his free time with his friends or playing video games. i don\u2019t care that he does that, but since he\u2019s no longer helping out around the house, i barely have any free time of my own since i sometimes work 10 hours in the day and spend the rest of it cooking/cleaning. i think its reasonable that he spends a little time helping out but he always tells me \u201cit\u2019s my day off and you want me to do laundry?\u201d as if i\u2019m crazy. or he tries to twist that i don\u2019t want him hanging out with his friends. so i basically just stopped doing his laundry for 2 weeks now and its been piling up. well, today he got mad at me because he had no clean boxers left and he had to go to work really soon so he didn\u2019t have time to wash any dirty ones. so now he\u2019s blaming me for not doing his laundry last night when i was doing my own. he had the day off yesterday but spent the entire day with his friends, but he easily could have thrown a load in before he went to his friends house. i told him thats the consequence of prioritizing fun over responsibilities all the time, and he cant always depend on me to do everything for him. he still thinks

great so far, we split work loads equally taking turns cooking and cleaning. although, i admit she is cooking more than me but i try to offset that by doing more around the house. we are both recent university graduates and for a long time i didn't really have enough money to buy myself new clothes, i now have a job that pays decently well and in turn i like to wear nice clothes to work. it isn't a suit and tie situation, but i like to wear nice polos and collared shirts etc. i like to hang my shirts to dry to avoid them shrinking and i feel like they just last longer when they are hung to dry. i am also on the husky side. not huge but i carry some extra weight around the midsection. this makes finding clothes a nightmare, finding a shirt that fits nicely and doesn't make me look bigger than i am while still being comfortable is tough so when i do find one i like i tend to load up. i have explained why i like to hang dry shirts to my so multiple times now and she seems to just completely ignore me. il come home when she does laundry and all of my shirts will be in the dryer repeatedly. it's not like she must hang every shirt i own, just my dress polos and dress shirts that aren't your typical graphic t. it's been making me mad but luckily up until now it hasn't rendered any shirts un-wearable. it just seems like a lack of respect for things that i clearly have spent some money on and talked nicely with her and explained the situation. i even offered to do the laundry for our household, but she said no. now last week one of my favorite stores had a big sale i got two nice basic tees and two nice dress polo shirts this time i was specific. i said \u201cthese cannot go in the dryer, i read online that they tend to shrink a bit and they fit me perfectly. i even made it into a funny joke like repeat after me, i will not dry bf's new work shirts etc. i wore them all to work last week and then went away to visit family for an extended weekend. i noticed when i got home that she did laundry and when i get up this morning i'm looking for one of these shirts, not in the closet so i go to the dryer and literally all the shirts are sitting in the dryer right on top. i try all three on. nope all four have shrunk to the point that they are to tight and i can't wear them. 4 shirts that i have literally owned for less than a week, ruined. i lost it this is the 5th time i have asked her nicely to hang dry shirts and have been ignored and now $130 in clothes that i wore once is too small. she says sorry but that it's so weird that i hang dry my shirts and that she doesn't think it's fair. i feel like it's common to hang dry certain clothing. she feels sorry, but i am still out $130, and she has made no effort to rectify the situation. am i the asshole

i am half german and half taiwanese. while i am not religious myself, my whole family on my mother's side is buddhist, and i grew up with the religion. the swastika is a buddhist religious symbol, and it is commonly seen in temples and on the chest of buddha statues.\n\nsome time ago, i bought a t-shirt. the design says \"rock buddha\", and it shows a cartoon buddha wearing sneakers and drinking coke, and - he has the swastika on his chest. i bought the shirt simply because i liked the design, i like rock music and buddhism was a pretty big part of my upbringing.\n\nbut of course i'm aware that the sign has a big nazi connotation outside of asia. i've been living in a german expat community in asia, and although there have been some fake-shocked/amused comments, everyone knows that i'm not a nazi and this isn't supposed to be a nazi symbol. it's all cool. but, i am moving to germany, and i'm not sure if it is still appropriate to wear the shirt there. my thinking is that the context of the buddha would make it clear to everyone that it is used in the religious sense, not the hateful one. but maybe the connection to buddhism isn't strong enough in europe? would it be offensive to

few other friends to a punk rock event that will be occurring next month. i (as well as many of the other friends that were invited) have no particular interest in punk rock but will be attending because it sounds like a fun time with the boys. the friend that invited us, on the other hand, is very into punk rock and has been trying to get us to listen to the bands he listens to for months. i think he sees this event as his big chance to get us into all these bands, but that's just speculation on my part.\n\nat this point we are fairly deep into the planning of the event. we have all bought our tickets, booked two hotel rooms, and arranged for how each of us will be getting to the venue. all this was planned without much trouble, but, surprisingly, we ran into an issue when it comes to what each of us will be wearing on the day of the event. talk about our respective outfits only began when the friend who is into punk rock encouraged us all to invest in \"battle jackets\" (basically jean jackets covered with a bunch of patches with references to various bands sewed into them). at first i looked into this, but quickly realized how much of an additional cost this would be, considering i'm already paying for my ticket and my part of the hotel cost. not to mention, considering i hardly know anything about these bands, a \"battle jacket\" wouldn't reflect my interests honestly. it was around this point in my thinking that i decided i would be wearing that shirt.\n\nthe shirt in question is one that many of you may be familiar with. it's the one from the collaboration between fakku and the doujin circle fatalpulse. for those unfamiliar, it features just the faces of anime girls in situations in which they're really feeling it, to put it one way. the many faces are blended together in such a way that i find to be truly aesthetically pleasing, without being too explicit. my friend thinks otherwise.\n\ni only recently let my friend know that this was the shirt i would be wearing to the event, during a conversation about the \"battle jackets\" that he and one of my other friends are constructing. he said that by wearing such a shirt to the event, i'm not only being an asshole to him, but to everyone at the event. he seems to think that many people at the event will be disturbed by the presence of someone wearing a shirt with hentai on it. i for one think that while the shirt does feature art from hentai, it is hardly explicit enough to offend anyone at the event. i would also really like to wear this shirt because i feel it displays my interests in a similarly blunt and aggressive way that a \"battle jacket\" would if my interests happened to lie within the realm of punk bands. additionally, this is a puck rock event.
